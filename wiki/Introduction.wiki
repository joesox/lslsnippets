LSLSnippetsApp comes with three LSLSnippet XML Files:

||llPlaySound.xml||Inserts a custom code in the beginning of the script. The custom method called PlaySound.  Inserts one line of code in touch_start code block. This line calls PlaySound.||
||llsay.xml||Inserts one llSay line of code in state_entry.  Inserts one llSay line of code in touch_start.||
||NotecardReaderv3.xml||This xml does a lot. This is re-usable script that inspired this project. After using this xml, your script can read notecards. This script does not read comment lines found in the notecard. It also reads comma-separated lines.||

These are example files you may use out-of-the-box and are also found in the [http://code.google.com/p/lslsnippets/downloads/list Downloads] area.
